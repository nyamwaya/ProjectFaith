								<h3>Adult Sabbath School</h3>
								<div class="box"><span class="image left"><img src="images/sabbathschool.jpg" alt=""></span>
									<p>Sabbath school classes are the heartbeat of our church community. Each week we spend time learning from Scripture and from each other. 

We offer several adult classes from which to choose.  So, come and find one that you can contribute to and receive a blessing.</p>
								</div>
                            	<h3>Children's Ministires</h3>
								<div class="box"><span class="image left"><img src="images/children.png" alt=""></span>
									<p>Each Sabbath morning, Sabbath schools for each age group welcome children to an hour of active learning geared to their stage of faith development. These classes provide faith-shaping experiences for newborns through adolescents. 
                                        Children's Sabbath Schools Beginners: birth–2 years old Kindergarten: 3–5 years old Primary: 6–9 years old (grades 1–4) Juniors: 10–11 years old (grade 5–6) Earliteen: 12–13 years old (grades 7–8) Youth: grades 9–12</p>
								</div>
                            	<h3>Community Service</h3>
								<div class="box"><span class="image left"><img src="images/community.jpg" alt=""></span>
									<p>Adventist Community Services meets people’s immediate needs through social services such as tutoring and mentoring programs, Youth Volunteer Corps, health screening education and assistance, inner city missions, and disaster response.</p>

                            <h3>Youth Ministries</h3>
								<div class="box"><span class="image left"><img src="images/ay.jpg" alt=""></span>
									<p>Youth Ministries means more than Sabbath school every week. Our youth ministry provides support and encouragement for young people at what can be a most critical part of their Christian experience.

The Youth have different activities and among them is a youth choir that sing in wonderful harmony. They have THREE (3) Audio CD's out entitled MSAMEHE NDUGUYO USAMEHEWE, UPENDO USIOPIMIKA and NIMETULIA KWENYE MWAMBA. You can order a copy by calling the church number and they will contact you.

Creating an environment where young people are safe to share and explore their faith, ask questions and openly express their challenges is one of the main goals of this ministry.

Of course, it would not be youth ministry without social time and lots of fun.  Check out the calendar for our next event.</p>

								<h3>Family Ministries</h3>
								<div class="box"><span class="image right"><img src="images/familyministry.png" alt=""></span>
									<p>The families in our church and community are under attack. Children are being exposed to more dangers and adults are stretched to the maximum.

No matter what you call family we want you to become an intimate part of our church family. If you are single or married, a grandparent or mother of two teenage children our church is the place for you.

If you would like to be a part of the ministries this church has for families contact the pastor for more information.</p>

                            	<h3>Men's Ministries</h3>
								<div class="box"><span class="image right"><img src="images/mensministries.jpg" alt=""></span>
									<p>Men doing ministry with and for men and the community--that's what Men's Ministries is all about. We are about more than the traditional service club, "knife and fork" kind of meetings. Not that those don't have a place. They do, but Men's Ministries is just what its title says: about ministry.

Our ministry includes everything from small group activities to extending a helping hand to individuals and families that need assistance with anything from moving to small projects.</p>
								</div>
                            	<h3>Pathfinder Club</h3>
